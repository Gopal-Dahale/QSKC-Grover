\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We briefly studied hardware and software-friendly ciphers.\pause
        \item We designed Quantum circuits for SAES, SIMON, PRESENT and optimized on qubits.\pause
        \item  As a result, the quantum architecture is not a barrier to a quantum adversary carrying out any potential quantum attack.\pause
        \item We discussed the parallelization of Grover's algorithm and its cost estimates which are used in modeling the quantum circuit and estimating the quantum resources for AES-128.\pause
        \item AES-128 was studied with and without depth constraints under the rules proposed by NIST \cite{nist}\footfullcite{nist}.\pause
        \item We implemented SAES and QSAES in python using Qiskit\cite{Qiskit}\footfullcite{Qiskit}  and libquantum\cite{libquantum}\footfullcite{libquantum}  to verify the results. We were unable to run a successful Grover's Attack as it was time-consuming. The code and obtained results are open-sourced \cite{Gopal}\footfullcite{Gopal} .
